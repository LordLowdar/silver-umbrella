## Installation

Make sure that you follow all install instructions, first change env file to match your login for mysql. After then log in to mysql in the terminal `mysql -u YOURUSERNAME -p` run the source schema `SOURCE db/schema.sql` then you can exit. Now you will need to do the node commands. This will include installing first `npm i` and also seeding the data `node run seed` I would personally do a `node run watch`. After you should have it started and ready to test in Insomnia.

## Usage

This is to demonstrate the interaction of routes and backend interface. Its an excellent blueprint.
